      Bluesky[b]Â is an AmericanÂ <span class="text-blue-600">microblogging</span>Â social mediaÂ service. Users can share short posts containing text, images, and videos.[11]Â It is owned by Bluesky Social PBC, aÂ benefit corporationÂ based in the United States.[12][13]Â The site is popular amongÂ <span class="text-blue-600">left-wing</span>Â andÂ <span class="text-blue-600">liberalÂ users</span>.[14]
Bluesky was developed as aÂ reference implementationÂ of theÂ AT Protocol, anÂ <span class="text-blue-600">openÂ communication protocol</span>Â forÂ distributed social networks.[15]Â Bluesky Social promotes aÂ composableÂ user experience andÂ <span class="text-blue-600">algorithmic</span>Â choice as core features of Bluesky.[16][17][18]Â The platform offers a "marketplace of algorithms" where users can choose or create algorithmic feeds, user-managed moderation andÂ labellingÂ services, and user-made "starter packs" that allow users to quickly follow a large number of related accounts within a community orÂ subculture.[19][20][21]Â The AT Protocol offers aÂ domain-nameâ€“based handle system within Bluesky, allowing users to self-verify an account's legitimacy and identity by proving ownership of a domain name.[21][22]
Bluesky began in 2019 as a research initiative at Twitter, becoming an independent company in 2021.[23][24]Â Development for the social app accelerated in 2022 afterÂ <span class="text-blue-600">Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter</span>Â and subsequent severing of ties between the companies.[25][26]Â Bluesky launched as anÂ <span class="text-blue-600">invitation-only</span>Â service in February 2023 and opened registrations in February 2024.[27]Â Former Twitter CEOÂ Jack DorseyÂ left Bluesky Social's board by May 2024.[28]Â The social media platform experienced a surge in activity in November 2024.[29]Â As of September 2025, Bluesky had 1.5 million daily active users, down 40% from March 2025, when the network had 2.5 million daily active users.[30]

          <span style="background-color:#FEF6E7;">Bluesky is largely analogous toÂ <span class="text-blue-600">Twitter</span>Â in its structure.<sup>[15]</sup>Â Users can send 300-character text messages, images, and video in short posts. Users can reply, repost, quote post and like these posts. Frequent users have called posts on the platform "skeets", aÂ <span class="text-blue-600">portmanteau</span>Â of "sky" and "tweets", despite CEOÂ <span class="text-blue-600">Jay Graber</span>'s vigorous disapproval of the term.<sup>[12][49][108]</sup>Â Bluesky offers aÂ domain name-based handle system[15]Â via theÂ AT Protocol, allowing users to self-verify an account's legitimacy and identity by proving ownership of a domain name through aÂ DNS text recordÂ orÂ HTTPSÂ page in lieu of a "blue check" system that other platforms use.<sup>[109]</sup>Â For example,Â <span class="text-blue-600">The Washington Post</span>Â uses their domain "washingtonpost.com" as their handle.<sup>[110]</sup>Â The specification does not handle changes in status of the domain names.<sup>[15]Â </sup>Unlike Twitter, Bluesky allows users far greater customizability of the experience, enabling users to choose custom algorithmic feeds and moderation services.<sup>[111][112]</sup>Â It also allows the usage of services through custom clients, a practice Twitter offered until January 2023.<sup>[113]</sup></span>Bluesky promotes a "marketplace of algorithms" through its custom feeds feature, where users can choose or create algorithmic feeds of posts related to the feed. Bluesky promotes a list of popular feeds in a dedicated section of their website and app.<sup>[114]</sup>Â Bluesky CTO <span class="text-blue-600">Paul Frazee</span> stated in 2023 that "In future updates [Bluesky] will make it easy for users to create custom feeds in-app."<sup>[19]</sup>Â Third-party tools to publish and find custom feeds on Bluesky have been created by independent developers, including websites like Skyfeed[115]Â and BlueskyFeeds.com.<sup>116]</sup>Â One popular use of custom feeds has been to create a way for users to bookmark posts by replying with a pin emoji (ðŸ“Œ),[117]Â a feature not natively implemented by the platform until 2025.<sup>[118]</sup>Â Custom feeds can also be used to filter posts by type, such as posts containing media like photos and videos. Third-party clients offering an interface similar toÂ <span class="text-blue-600">TikTok</span>Â andÂ InstagramÂ have been created using these feeds.<sup>[119]</sup>Â Starter packs are lists of users who have some relation to a topic, organization, or community that can be created by users that allow others to quickly follow individual users, or everybody within the pack at once. The feature was introduced in June 2024.<sup>[120]</sup>Â A similar feature (albeit with creation limited to a group of users chosen by the platform) was implemented onÂ Threads.<sup>[121]</sup>
Moderation in Bluesky is similarly customizable by end users, allowing the creation and usage of custom services with their own policies and labelling mechanisms that differ from Bluesky's official moderation service. Such services can label posts to alert the user, or hide the post entirely. These services can facilitate the creation of novel ways to use Bluesky, such as blocking posts containingÂ generative artificial intelligence,[122]Â or labelling politicians who have accepted contributions.[123]Â Users can also create custom moderation lists that allow others to mute or block the accounts contained within the list, although the system can be abused.[124]Â Bluesky open-sourced its in-house moderation software called "Ozone" in March 2024 for these services.[125]
